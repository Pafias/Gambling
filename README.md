# Minecraft Gambling

I wanted to mess around with the new [Minecraft Dialogs](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Dialog).

What better way to do that, than to make [Blackjack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackjack) am I right? Who doesn't love a little gambling?!

Ya know what they say: **99% of gamblers quit before they hit it big.**

Only Blackjack is available. Who knows if I'll expand in the future...
